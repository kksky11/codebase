However, if banks and NBFCs access your report when you apply for a credit product like a credit card or a loan it is seen as a “hard enquiry” and can impact your score. Making a soft enquiry of your credit score once a month is a good practice to keep a check on your credit score."

However, the cost of getting a copy of your credit report directly from a bureau varies from one credit bureau to another. From credit bureaus, you can avail full credit report for free once a year. Other times, it will cost you around Rs 500 per report."
